# Image-Recognition-Experiment
Stand-alone experiment to test Swift's built-in machine learning capabilities on the desktop.

## Raison D'etre
The examples provided by Apple and third parties for using the image classification capabilities of CoreML tend to focus upon iOS platforms and on building and training a model.  This repository contains a stand-alone application onto which a user can drag and drop an image file and have a pre-trained image classifier produce its best guess.
